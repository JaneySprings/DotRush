## Working with Projects and Solutions
&emsp;If your folder contains multiple projects or a solution file, DotRush will show the following picker for all projects and solutions in the folder. DotRush automatically saves selected projects and solutions in the workspace settings. You can open it manually by executing the `DotRush: Pick Project or Solution files` command:

## Running and Debugging .NET Core Applications
&emsp;To run and debug your .NET Core applications, you can use the built-in .NET Core Debugger. You can start debugging by pressing **F5** and select the **.NET Core Debugger** configuration. You can also create a `launch.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": ".NET Core Debugger (launch)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${command:dotrush.activeTargetPath}",
            "preLaunchTask": "dotrush: Build"
        },
        {
            "name": ".NET Core Debugger (attach)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "attach",
            "processId": "${command:dotrush.pickProcess}"
        }
    ]
}
```
&emsp;You can change the startup project by clicking on it and executing the `Set as Startup Project` command from the context menu. You can also change the debugger options in the VSCode settings.

## Running and Debugging NUnit / xUnit Tests
&emsp;To run and debug your **NUnit** or **xUnit** tests, you can use the integrated Test Explorer in VSCode. Run test by clicking on the run button next to the test or debug it by right-clicking on the run button and selecting the `Debug Test` option in the context menu.

## Debugging Unity Projects
&emsp;To debug your Unity project, you can use the integrated Mono Debugger. Open the Unity project in VSCode (for example, by opening it from the Unity Editor) and start debugging by pressing **F5** and select the **Unity Debugger** configuration. You can also create a `launch.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Unity Debugger",
            "type": "unity",
            "request": "attach"
        }
    ]
}
```

&emsp;You can change the debugger options in the VSCode settings.

## Debugging Godot Projects
&emsp;To debug your Godot project, open it in VSCode and create a `launch.json` file with the following content (adjust the `processPath` to the location of your Godot Engine executable):
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": ".NET Core Debugger (attach)",
            "type": "coreclr",
            "request": "attach",
            "processPath": "C:\\Programs\\Godot\\Godot_v4.4.1-stable_mono_win64.exe",
            "preLaunchTask": "dotrush: Build"
        }
    ]
}
```

&emsp;Press **F5** to start debugging. It will launch the Godot Engine and attach the debugger to it:

## Profiling .NET Core Applications
&emsp;To profile your .NET Core applications, you can use the built-in **dotnet-trace** and **dotnet-gcdump** tools. You can attach the profiler to a running process by executing the `DotRush: Attach Trace Profiler` or `DotRush: Create Heap Dump` commands. Also you can use the following buttons in the debugger toolbar if you have the **.NET Core Debugger** running:

- For the `trace` report, you can use the [Speedscope in VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sransara.speedscope-in-vscode) extension to view it. Alternatively, you can upload it directly to the [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app) site.
- For the `gcdump` report, you can use the [dotnet-heapview](https://github.com/1hub/dotnet-heapview) or _Visual Studio for Windows_.

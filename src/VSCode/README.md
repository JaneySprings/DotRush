### C# Development Environment for Visual Studio Code
&emsp;DotRush is a `C#` Language Server, designed to unlock various IDE capabilities. DotRush helps you organize multiple projects and includes features for `code editing`, `refactoring` and `error detection`. Even in the most extensive projects, DotRush is a resource-friendly companion, ensuring you stay productive and focused.

### DotRush (VSCode) vs C# Dev Kit
 
&emsp;DotRush works indepdendanly of C# Dev Kit and may conflict in certain usage scenarios. That's why you need to disable C# Dev Kit to use DotRush. Here are a few advantigures offered by DotRush:
- Efficient Resource Utilization. Experience significantly reduced resource consumption, with minimal CPU and memory usage even in large projects.
- Enhanced Multi-Targeting Support. See the following sections for additional information: IntelliSense in Multi-Target Projects, Cross-Platform Error Detection.
 
&emsp;It's essential to note some limitations when compared to the C# Dev Kit:
- Blazor projects are not supported.
- Built-in .NET Core debugger is not supporeted, but I'm working on it.

### IntelliSense in Multi-Target Projects
&emsp;DotRush offers IntelliSense for multiple Target Frameworks. For example, when you're working on a cross-platform application and your current target framework is Android, DotRush provides IntelliSense capabilities for iOS, too.

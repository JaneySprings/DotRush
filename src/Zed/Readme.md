## Configuration

DotRush extension can be configured in Zed by creating a [settings.json file](https://zed.dev/docs/configuring-zed#settings-files) in your project root directory. 

### Basic Configuration

You only need to provide the `projectOrSolutionFiles` option at minimum, but can customize the behavior further with additional settings as needed.

```json
{
    "lsp": {
        "dotrush": {
            "settings": {
                "dotrush": {
                    "roslyn": {
                        // Paths to project or solution files to load
                        "projectOrSolutionFiles": [
                            "/path/to/your/solution.sln"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### All Configuration Options


All available configuration options can be found in the DotRush extension's [package.json](https://github.com/JaneySprings/DotRush/blob/main/package.json) file. Any option under the `dotrush.roslyn` namespace can be used in your settings file with the structure shown above.
